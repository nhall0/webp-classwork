Hello! My name is Niklas Hallstein, I’m majoring in Computer Science. I’ve taken CS1 – CS3, OOP, Software Engineering, and Assembly. I currently work at a cyber-security consulting company, as a member of development operations. I’ve worked on various projects on AWS and Azure, for a wide portfolio of clients. Generally, I focus on the back end, but I’m capable of full-stack development as well. My favored language is python, but I have experience with C, C#, C++, Java, JS, and Lua.

I hope this class will fill the blanks within my skillset, specifically, with front-end development and the work that goes into setting up client-facing projects. This class will improve my capabilities as a career programmer and prove me more capable than before to face my client’s growing needs. Web development is a constantly growing and changing field, so it’s also important to get a good foundation of industry practices. I hope I can also properly grasp these, in order to stay present in a shifting climate.
